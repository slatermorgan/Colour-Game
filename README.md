RGB Colour Game
---------------

This web game created in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript randomly generates 6 / 3 colours (depending on difficulty setting).
These colours are then pushed to squares which the user can click on. The user then is given an RGB colour which corresponds 
to one of them. Once the correct colour is clicked on, a winning message is displayed.

INSTALLATION
